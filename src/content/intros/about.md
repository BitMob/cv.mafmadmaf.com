劉宇恆（maf）是一名平面設計師，美術指導，多媒體藝術家（a.k.a. mafmadmaf），喜歡貓。嚮往極簡主義，熱愛探索和創造、打破常規，樂於向觀眾呈現克制而精美的設計和音樂。在過去的十年，以設計服務多個知名品牌，曾擁有自己的一人印刷工作室和一家設計工作室（bitmob.cc）；最近剛完成一套西文字體：KNOOB，和以工作室的名義推出一款 iOS 應用程序（WTDT）。

十年來，從無間斷地接觸紙張和裝幀，鑽研絲網印刷和 Risograph 印刷技術，熱愛印刷品，也鐘情於文字、字體設計。2015 年開始，對 UI/UX 領域產生濃厚興趣，研習 Web 平面和交互設計，視之為「流動的平面」（相對於印刷品所代表的「靜態的平面」）。在多媒體藝術的探索上，用合成器作曲、做聲音設計；也使用 Max/MSP 和 Supercollider 等前沿的計算機技術為創作方法。近年在摩登天空等廠牌發表作品；參加東京模塊音樂節（Tokyo Festival of Modular）等交流活動。

在新媒介、用新科技、做新設計。但無論媒介為何，一直堅信形式感與內容應該是雙向設計的。

Liu Yuheng (maf) is a graphic designer, art director, multimedia artist (a.k.a. mafmadmaf) and likes cats. I yearn for minimalism, love to explore and create, break the rules, and am happy to present restraint and exquisite design and music to the audience. In the past ten years, he has served many well-known brands with design, and has his own one-person printing studio and a design studio (bitmob.cc); recently completed a set of Western fonts: KNOOB, and in the name of the studio Launched an iOS application (WTDT).

In the past ten years, I have been in constant contact with paper and binding, studied screen printing and Risograph printing technology, loved prints, and also loved text and font design. Since 2015, he has developed a strong interest in the field of UI/UX, studying web graphics and interaction design, and treating them as "flowing graphics" (as opposed to the "static graphics" represented by printed matter). In the exploration of multimedia art, he used synthesizers to compose music and design sounds; he also used cutting-edge computer technologies such as Max/MSP and Supercollider to create methods. In recent years, he has published works on Modern Sky and other labels; he has participated in exchange activities such as Tokyo Festival of Modular.

Use new media, new technology, and new designs. But regardless of the medium, I have always believed that the sense of form and content should be designed in both directions.
