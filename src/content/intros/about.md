maf is a graphic designer, art director, multimedia artist (a.k.a. mafmadmaf) and likes cats. I yearn for minimalism, love to explore and create, break the rules, and am happy to present restraint and exquisite design and music to the audience. In the past ten years, he has served many well-known brands with design, and has his own one-person printing studio and a design studio (bitmob.cc); recently completed a set of Western fonts: KNOOB, and in the name of the studio Launched an iOS application (WTDT).

In the past ten years, I have been in constant contact with paper and binding, studied screen printing and Risograph printing technology, loved prints, and also loved text and font design. Since 2015, he has developed a strong interest in the field of UI/UX, studying web graphics and interaction design, and treating them as "flowing graphics" (as opposed to the "static graphics" represented by printed matter). In the exploration of multimedia art, he used synthesizers to compose music and design sounds; he also used cutting-edge computer technologies such as Max/MSP and Supercollider to create methods. In recent years, he has published works on Modern Sky and other labels; he has participated in exchange activities such as Tokyo Festival of Modular.

Use new media, new technology, and new designs. But regardless of the medium, I have always believed that the sense of form and content should be designed in both directions.
