「玩具一定要放在手上玩」，阿 Go 每次拿起他自己的收藏，都藏不住那份興奮和愛護。作為一個玩具藏家和手工玩具製作者，參加過香港、韓國的大型玩具展，而生活在廣州的他，常常帶著廣州人的隨性，但一旦進入工作狀態，那種執著也時常感染身邊的人。這個展覽正是為了向大家介紹，在這裏有一個這樣自由生活、認真工作（玩）的人。maf 作為活動的策展人，除了擔任設計之外，當時也用影像紀錄了他的工作和生活和三隻貓。

As a toy collector and handmade toy designer and maker, he (Mr. Go) has participated in large-scale toy exhibitions in Hong Kong and South Korea. He lives in Guangzhou, with the casualness of a Cantonese, but once he enters the working state, that kind of attachment also often affects the people around. This exhibition was to introduce him to everyone, here is a person who lives freely and works (plays) seriously here. As the curator of the event, in addition to being a designer, maf also made a short documentary [video](http://v.qq.com/vplus/05f2281011c7dbbd6f356522325b0902?page=video) of his work and life and three cats.
