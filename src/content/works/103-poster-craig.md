Craig Kirk 是一個在廣州生活的工作的英國人，擁有一份嚴肅的工作，（因此）他還是一名插畫師。他會在平時用手機拍到的照片上，添加上自己的卡通畫，無論地點是廣州、上海、北京。這次展覽的主視覺，也是圍繞著他的卡通畫風而創作。雖然我們之間文化差異不小，然而「無聊的廣州」卻是我們共同的感覺。 ~~對不起，我是廣州人。~~

Craig Kirk was an Englishman who lived and worked in Guangzhou. In addition to having a serious job, he was also an illustrator. He will add his own style cartoons to the photos he usually takes on his mobile phone, regardless of the location in Guangzhou, Shanghai, or Beijing. The main visual of this exhibition was also created around his cartoon style.
