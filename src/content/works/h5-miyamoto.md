為配合岡本在京東 618 促銷推廣，廣告公司與 BitMob 合作，策劃了這個長條 H5。其故事改編自日本武士宮本武藏的生平，採用「一鏡到底」的長條交互敘事方式，BitMob 一手包辦了其中的元素設計、浮世繪拼貼、聲效、編程等工作。

Storytelling on a mobile screen could be tricky, especially when it requires immersion and interaction. In this case, it was about Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese samurai icon. To present this household story in a new way, we cooperated with a senior copywriter to adapt it into new plots, with responsive animations and sound effects, and merge them into a non-stop interactive long scroll. Apart from sounds and animations, the beautiful Ukiyo-e paintings, that we carefully picked out as parallax layers, were the magic to bring a movie-like yet vintage flavour to the whole campaign.
